paozhu(ÁÇÆÁ´πüß®) is a comprehensive and fast C++ web framework that integrates C++ ORM. The development speed is as
fast as script languages. The framework integrates a webserver, which can natively parse HTTP/1.1 HTTP/2 JSON WebSocket protocols
and GET and POST requests. The framework also distinguishes between different methods of POST requests. The framework
comes with a built-in OBJ micro-object that can store data such as char, int, string, float, etc. The framework
automatically parses URL and POST parameters into the micro-object, and uses URL path mapping to function mounting
points. It also uses coroutines, thread pools, and database connection pools.

‚úÖ 7. Support synchronization of httpclient get post  
‚úÖ 8. The framework comes with an ORM. It uses the link pool method and currently supports MySQL  
‚úÖ 9. Framework has two thread pool,framework thread pool,user program runing thread pool  
‚úÖ10. The framework uses asio Coroutines  
‚úÖ11. The framework features that I/O uses the coroutine pool to run and thread pool to run  
‚úÖ12. The framework supports compress gzip br out files  
‚úÖ13. The framework parses the URL and POST. The parsing result is similar to the PHP GET POST method to obtain the
content
